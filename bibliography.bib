	abstract = {Many large social networks are a complex combination of smaller groups or subgraphs. Identifying groups within a network and mapping their relationship to one another can be essential to making intelligent strategic decisions. Network analysis can help identify competing or complementary groups, potential allies to form a powerful group, and individuals who can connect one to a new group. Identifying and visualizing groups is also a powerful strategy for making sense of large networks. Social network analysis provides a set of tools for identifying and understanding groups, also called clusters or communities by network researchers. In the language of network analysis, clusters are pockets of densely connected vertices that are only sparsely connected to other pockets. One of the powers of social network analysis is that it can be used to automatically identify clusters that one may not have known to look for ahead of time. These naturally occurring clusters are based on patterns of social ties rather than formal group memberships. This chapter describes how clusters can be identified and visualized in NodeXL.},

The resulting layout is clustered using a single link algorithm. This clustering is used to produce a coarsened graph (fewer nodes) which is then re-drawn. this process is repeated until a sufficiently small graph is produced. The smallest graph is drawn and then used as a basis for drawing the original graph by refining the series of coarsened graphs that were produced. The layout engine can be run in serial or in parallel.},

	abstract = {Networks are proving to be central to the study of gene function, protein–protein interaction, and biochemical pathway data. Visualization of networks is important for their study, but visualization tools are often inadequate for working with very large biological networks. Here, we present an algorithm, called large graph layout (LGL), which can be used to dynamically visualize large networks on the order of hundreds of thousands of vertices and millions of edges. LGL applies a force-directed iterative layout guided by a minimal spanning tree of the network in order to generate coordinates for the vertices in two or three dimensions, which are subsequently visualized and interactively navigated with companion programs. We demonstrate the use of LGL in visualizing an extensive protein map summarizing the results of ∼21 billion sequence comparisons between 145,579 proteins from 50 genomes. Proteins are positioned in the map according to sequence homology and gene fusions, with the map ultimately serving as a theoretical framework that integrates inferences about gene function derived from sequence homology, remote homology, gene fusions, and higher-order fusions. We confirm that protein neighbors in the resulting map are functionally related, and that distinct map regions correspond to distinct cellular systems, enabling a computational strategy for discovering proteins' functions on the basis of the proteins' map positions. Using the map produced by LGL, we infer general functions for 23 uncharacterized protein families. LGL is freely available (at http://bioinformatics.icmb.utexas.edu/lgl).},

	abstract = {Network meta-analysis (NMA) has become an increasingly used tool to compare multiple treatments simultaneously by synthesizing direct and indirect evidence in clinical research. However, many existing studies did not properly report the evidence of treatment comparisons and show the comparison structure to audience. In addition, nearly all treatment networks presented only direct evidence, not overall evidence that can reflect the benefit of performing NMAs. This article classifies treatment networks into three types under different assumptions; they include networks with each treatment comparison's edge width proportional to the corresponding number of studies, sample size, and precision. In addition, three new measures (ie, the effective number of studies, the effective sample size, and the effective precision) are proposed to preliminarily quantify overall evidence gained in NMAs. They permit audience to intuitively evaluate the benefit of performing NMAs, compared with pairwise meta-analyses based on only direct evidence. We use four case studies, including one illustrative example, to demonstrate their derivations and interpretations. Treatment networks may look fairly differently when different measures are used to present the evidence. The proposed measures provide clear information about overall evidence of all treatment comparisons, and they also imply the additional number of studies, sample size, and precision obtained from indirect evidence. Some comparisons may benefit little from NMAs. Researchers are encouraged to present overall evidence of all treatment comparisons, so that audience can preliminarily evaluate the quality of NMAs.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a new spectral partitioning formulation which directly incorporates vertex size information by modifying the Laplacian of the graph. Modifying the Laplacian produces a generalized eigenvalue problem, which is reduced to the standard eigenvalue problem. Experiments show that the scaled ratio-cut costs of results on benchmarks with arbitrary vertex size improve by 22\% when the eigenvectors of the Laplacian in the spectral partitioner KP are replaced by the eigenvectors of our modified Laplacian. The inability to handle vertex sizes in the spectral partitioning formulation has been a limitation in applying spectral partitioning in a multilevel setting. We investigate whether our new formulation effectively removes this limitation by combining it with a simple multilevel bottom-up clustering algorithm and an iterative improvement algorithm for partition refinement. Experiments show that in a multilevel setting where the spectral partitioner KP provides the initial partitions of the most contracted graph, using the modified Laplacian in place of the standard Laplacian is more efficient and more effective in the partitioning of graphs with arbitrary-size and unit-size vertices; average improvements of 17\% and 18\% are observed for graphs with arbitrary-size and unit-size vertices, respectively. Comparisons with other ratio-cut based partitioners on hypergraphs with unit-size as well as arbitrary-size vertices, show that the multilevel spectral partitioner produces either better results or almost identical results more efficiently.},

Three contentions about the Question are evaluated: arguments that Community is Lost, Saved or Liberted. Data are presented about the structure and use of the "intimate" networks of 845 adult residents of East York, Toronto. Intimate networks are found to be prevalent, composed of both kin and nonkin, nonlocal, asymmetric, and of sparse density. Help in dealing with both emergencies and everyday matters is available from almost all intimate networks, but from only a minority of intimate ties.

It begins with background on setting egocentric network boundaries and principal types of instruments that obtain information about such networks. It then discusses innovations in data collection and studies of data quality. The bulk of these address questions about “name generator” instruments that obtain information about the alters and relationships in a subject's network. Among topics receiving substantial attention in recent research are mitigation of respondent burden, interviewer effects, survey mode, and the performance of name generators in longitudinal studies. Potentially fruitful innovations supplement conventional question-and-answer surveys with visual elements that promise to better engage respondents and reduce the demands that name generator-based data collection poses. We close by highlighting both accomplishments of this body of research and some open issues.},

	abstract = {Many complex networks have a small-world topology characterized by dense local clustering or cliquishness of connections between neighboring nodes yet a short path length between any (distant) pair of nodes due to the existence of relatively few long-range connections. This is an attractive model for the organization of brain anatomical and functional networks because a small-world topology can support both segregated/specialized and distributed/integrated information processing. Moreover, small-world networks are economical, tending to minimize wiring costs while supporting high dynamical complexity. The authors introduce some of the key mathematical concepts in graph theory required for small-world analysis and review how these methods have been applied to quantification of cortical connectivity matrices derived from anatomical tract-tracing studies in the macaque monkey and the cat. The evolution of small-world networks is discussed in terms of a selection pressure to deliver cost-effective information-processing systems. The authors illustrate how these techniques and concepts are increasingly being applied to the analysis of human brain functional networks derived from electroencephalography/magnetoencephalography and fMRI experiments. Finally, the authors consider the relevance of small-world models for understanding the emergence of complex behaviors and the resilience of brain systems to pathological attack by disease or aberrant development. They conclude that small-world models provide a powerful and versatile approach to understanding the structure and function of human brain systems.},

Phylogenies only provide a narrow view of these gene flows: plasmids and viruses, lacking core genes, cannot be attached to cellular life on phylogenetic trees. Yet viruses and plasmids have a major impact on cellular evolution, affecting both the gene content and the dynamics of microbial communities. Using bipartite graphs that connect up to 149,000 clusters of homologous genes with 8,217 related and unrelated genomes, we can in particular show patterns of gene sharing that do not map neatly with the organismal phylogeny. Homologous genes are recycled by lateral gene transfer, and multiple copies of homologous genes are carried by otherwise completely unrelated (and possibly nested) genomes, that is, viruses, plasmids and prokaryotes. When a homologous gene is present on at least one plasmid or virus and at least one chromosome, a process of “gene externalization,” affected by a postprocessed selected functional bias, takes place, especially in Bacteria. Bipartite graphs give us a view of vertical and horizontal gene flow beyond classic taxonomy on a single very large, analytically tractable, graph that goes beyond the cellular Web of Life.},

	abstract = {Objective/Aim: We describe best practices for modeling egocentric networks and health outcomes using a five-step guide.
Background: Social network analysis (SNA) is common in social science fields and has more recently been used to study health-related topics including obesity, violence, substance use, health organizational behavior, and healthcare utilization. SNA, alone or in conjunction with spatial analysis, can be used to uniquely evaluate the impact of the physical or built environment on health. The environment can shape the presence, quality, and function of social relationships with spatial and network processes interacting to affect health outcomes. While there are some common measures frequently used in modeling the impact of social networks on health outcomes, there is no standard approach to social network modeling in health research, which impacts rigor and reproducibility.
Methods: We provide an overview of social network concepts and terminology focused on egocentric network data. Egocentric, or personal networks, take the perspective of an individual who identifies their own connections (alters) and also the relationships between alters.
Results: We describe best practices for modeling egocentric networks and health outcomes according to the following five-step guide: (1) model selection, (2) social network exposure variable and selection considerations, (3) covariate selection related to sociodemographic and health characteristics, (4) covariate selection related to social network characteristics, and (5) analytic considerations. We also present an example of SNA.
Conclusions: SNA provides a powerful repertoire of techniques to examine how relationships impact attitudes, experiences, and behaviors—and subsequently health.},

In this article, we argue that a social media approach to social-ecological crises can offer an actor-centered meaningful perspective on social facts, a depiction of the general dynamics of meaning making that takes place among actors, and a systemic view of actors’ communication before, during and after the crisis. On the basis of a multi-technique approach to Twitter data (TF-IDF, hierarchical clustering, egocentric networks and principal component analysis) applied to a red tide crisis on Chiloé Island, Chile, in 2016, the most significant red tide in South America ever, we offer a view on the boundaries and dynamics of meaning making in a social-ecological crisis. We conclude that this dynamics shows a permanent reflexive work on elucidating the causes and effects of the crisis that develops according to actors’ commitments, the sequence of events, and political conveniences. In this vein, social media analysis does not replace good qualitative research, it rather opens up supplementary possibilities for capturing meanings from the past that cannot be retrieved otherwise. This is particularly relevant for studying social-ecological crises and supporting collective learning processes that point towards increased resilience capacities and more sustainable trajectories in affected communities.},

It is argued that the degree of overlap of two individuals' friendship networks varies directly with the strength of their tie to one another. The impact of this principle on diffusion of influence and information, mobility opportunity, and community organization is explored. Stress is laid on the cohesive power of weak ties. Most network models deal, implicitly, with strong ties, thus confining their applicability to small, well-defined groups. Emphasis on weak ties lends itself to discussion of relations between groups and to analysis of segments of social structure not easily defined in terms of primary groups.},

Instead of viewing the genetic parts list of an organism as a loose collection of biochemical activities, in the best case, we anticipate discrete networks of function to bridge the gap between genotype and phenotype, and to do so in a more profound way than the current qualitative classification of linked reactions into familiar pathways, such as glycolysis and the MAPK signal transduction cascades. At the present time, however, we are still far from a complete answer to the most basic question: what can we learn about biology by studying networks? Promising steps in this direction have come from such diverse approaches as mathematical analysis of global network structure, partitioning networks into functionally related modules and motifs, and even de novo design of networks. A complete picture will probably require integrating the data obtained from all of these approaches with modeling efforts at many different levels of detail.},

	abstract = {While social networks have been examined in the context of many economic choices and outcomes, this study is the first to investigate the effects of social networks on health service utilization decisions. Networks can affect utilization decisions in many ways. They can provide information on institutional details of the health care system, and can reduce the search costs of locating an appropriate health care provider. Networks can even alter the demand for services by affecting the perceived efficacy or desirability of the available services. Using health service utilization decisions to study networks has two main advantages over work that studies other public programs. First, because health care in Canada is universal, there are no questions of eligibility. Second, by studying the different measures of utilization, it is possible to observe how the network effects vary across measures that reflect visits primarily instigated by the patient, to measures that reflect visits instigated by both patients and their physician. Using data from three cycles of the Canadian National Population Health Survey, this work exploits regional and language group variation to identify network effects. Strong and robust evidence of networks effects is found on the decision to utilize services reflecting initial contact with the health care system. As well, this work presents novel evidence that utilization of health services by immigrants increases with the number of doctors that speak their language in their neighborhood.},

A flexible and multi-task architecture brings new possibilities to work with complex data sets and produce valuable visual results.  We present several key features of Gephi in the context of interactive exploration and interpretation of networks. It provides easy and broad access to network data and allows for spatializing, filtering, navigating, manipulating and clustering. Finally, by presenting dynamic features of Gephi, we highlight key aspects of dynamic network visualization.},

	abstract = {Summary: Cytoscape is a popular bioinformatics package for biological network visualization and data integration. Version 2.8 introduces two powerful new features—Custom Node Graphics and Attribute Equations—which can be used jointly to greatly enhance Cytoscape's data integration and visualization capabilities. Custom Node Graphics allow an image to be projected onto a node, including images generated dynamically or at remote locations. Attribute Equations provide Cytoscape with spreadsheet-like functionality in which the value of an attribute is computed dynamically as a function of other attributes and network properties.Availability and implementation: Cytoscape is a desktop Java application released under the Library Gnu Public License (LGPL). Binary install bundles and source code for Cytoscape 2.8 are available for download from http://cytoscape.org.Contact:  msmoot@ucsd.edu},

The goal of each approach is to provide the user with the ability to apply the flexibility of ggplot2 to the visualization of network data, including through the mapping of network attributes to specific plot aesthetics. By incorporating networks in the ggplot2 framework, these approaches (1) allow users to enhance networks with additional information on edges and nodes, (2) give access to the strengths of ggplot2, such as layers and facets, and (3) convert network data objects to the more familiar data frames.},
